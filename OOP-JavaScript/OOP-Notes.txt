Object Oriented Programming:
	- OOP is a fundamental and most popular Programming paradigm used by nearly every developer at some point in their career for the software developemnt.

Structure of Object Oriented Programming
	- Classes
		- user defined data types.
		- where we create a blueprint for the structure of methods and attributes.
		- classes contains fields of attributes and methods of behaviors.
		- Example: Simple Person example;
		- class Person{
			//constructor function
			constructor(name, age){
				this.name = name;
				this.age = age;
			}

			getName(){
				return this.name;
			}

			getAge(){
				return this.age;
			}
		}
	- objects
		- these are the instances of class created with specific data.
		- example: for the above person class
		- cosnt david = new Person("david", 23);

		- a new object is being created with name david
		- the constructor runs name & age arguments, and assigns values
	- attributes
		- these are the information that is being stored.
		- these are defined inside the class template and represents the state of an object.

	- methods
		- these are the functions defined inside the class template and describes the behavior of an object.

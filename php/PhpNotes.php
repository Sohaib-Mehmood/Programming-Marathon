installed:
    - Home brew
    - curl
    - php
    - mysql
php help:
    - php -h

run the html file using the followning commands:
    - php -S localhost:8888
Points:
    - to get the full power of the PHP, we shoould be creating the index.php file instead of index.html file.

variables:
    $varName;
        - example;
            $yourName = "sohaib".
code refactoring is done through variable, because of the reusability.
